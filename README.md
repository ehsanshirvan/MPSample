# MPSample
This project sample is swagger activated third-party to interact with and for testing the API you need just open browser and set Url to "/swagger".
There is no more library needed for building and running the project and when you would clone the project it must be built easily.
The API hosted by IISExpress on port No 41284 by default. Also the solution contains one test project to test the methods by using xUnit library. This project contains a setting file 
named TestAppSettings.json which includes an item named InMemoryMode and by this property you can choose that the test project runs on SqlServer database or on InMemoyry database 
and also we have the same property in MPSample.API project setting file(appsettings.json) called UseInMemoryDatabase so you can either choose working with Inmemory database or with 
Sql Server database.
